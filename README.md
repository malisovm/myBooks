This is a sample book management app written to learn Bootstrap, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, Firebase, and how to make these work together.

The filter works as a Redux slice (client state management), the cards themselves via RTK Query (server state management with Firebase as the source of truth).

Live version [here](https://mybooks.cyclic.app/).

The source code is in the /dev branch, the compiled version in the /deploy branch.
